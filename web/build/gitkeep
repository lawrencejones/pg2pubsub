# This file ensures we always create a .gitkeep in the build directory, allowing
# us to include just the .gitkeep file into git. We do this so the build.go can
# embed the build directory even when we haven't yet compiled the production
# assets, aiding local development.
#
# There is a pre-flight check in build.go that breaks the build if the assets
# aren't valid when releasing.
